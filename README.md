[Gulp][1] is a recently spawned streaming build system which shows a lot of 
promise. It brings [a really terse code-base][2] to the table, which you can 
actually walk through _in under ten minutes_. That's a lot to say when pitching
it against Grunt, which is [quite larger][3] than that. Remember Grunt? I've
[blogged about it extensively][4] in the past, and I'm [even writing a book][5]
which features Grunt as its go-to build tool. It's an awesome _tool_, you should
try it some time. [Some people][6] claim that Grunt will eventually be gulped by
Gulp, and surely more will follow. I find this to be [outrageous, egregious, preposterous][7].
It's not as clear cut, Grunt has _a lot of benefits_ over Gulp, and so does Gulp
over Grunt. In this article I aim to **introduce Gulp**, as it's fairly new,
having been released _around 6 months ago_. Then, _I'll compare it with Grunt_,
pointing out which tool does what better, and why. [![gulp.png][8]][1]
